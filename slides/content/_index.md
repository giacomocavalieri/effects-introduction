## Effects

The essence of programming ultimately boils down to performing effects. As Simon Peyton Jones puts it:

 >If a program has no side-effects there's no point in running it, isn't it? You have a black box, you press go and it gets hot but there's no output <sup>[\^1](#resources)</sup>

---

## A simple running example

Being undoubtedly very convenient, many languages allow the programmer to use _statements_ as a way to perform unrestricted side-effects: I/O, failure, non-determinism, ...

```scala
def maybeDouble(n: Int): Int =
  println("Flipping a coin")
  val heads = util.Random.nextBoolean
  if heads then n*2 else n
```

---

The problem with unrestricted side-effects is that there no longer is _referential transparency:_ while one can factor out duplicate values the same is not true for statements, they are not easily testable and it is overall harder to reason about the program's behavior

```scala
val program1: Int = maybeDouble(1) + maybeDouble(1)
val program2: Int = {Â val n = maybeDouble(1); n + n }
// the two programs are not equivalent since maybeDouble
// performs side effects
```

---

## Monads to the rescue

In a purely functional world the key difference is that a program no longer performs the side effects but it is an immutable data structure that _describes_ what side effects need to be performed:

```scala
def maybeDouble(n: Int): IO[Int] = for
  _     <- IO.println("Flipping a coin")
  heads <- IO(util.Random.nextBoolean)
yield (if heads then n*2 else n)
```

```haskell
maybeDouble :: Int -> IO Int
maybeDouble n = do
  putStrLn "Flipping a coin"
  heads <- randomIO
  pure $ if heads then n*2 else n
```

---

Thanks to the `IO` monad one can treat _programs as first-class values:_

```scala
val p = maybeDouble(10)
val ns: IO[List[Int]] = List.fill(5)(p).sequence
```

`p` is not an integer value that could be either 10 or 20; it is an immutable data structure that describes the logic with which 10 may or may not be doubled by performing side-effects

---

## The problem with IO

Simply using `IO` does not magically solve our problems:

- the code inside `IO` is just as hard to test as the impure counterpart
- inside `IO` I could perform _all kinds_ of I/O (read a file, send messages over  
  the network, fail with an exception, ...)
- having the `IO` monad everywhere is like not having it at all!

---

## Goals of an effect system

We wish to express the side effects our code can perform in a way that:

- the code can be _easily composed and tested_
- the correct handling of side effects is _checked at compile-time_
- the side effects can be expressed with a _granularity suitable for our business needs_

---

Each effect system can be evaluated in terms of:

- cognitive load
- ease of use
- composability
- testability
- performance
- maturity
- ...

## Monad Stacks

Thanks to _monad transformers,_ monads can be _stacked_ together to obtain composite monads
that provide the side effects of each one of the monads composing the stack

```scala
// Enrich M[_] with the effects of the Maybe monad (failure)
final case class MaybeT[M[_], A](runMaybeT : M[Maybe[A]])
// Enrich M[_] with the effects of the State monad (global mutable state)
final case class StateT[S, M[_], A](runStateT : S => M[(A, S)])
// Enrich M[_] with the effects of the Reader monad (global read-only state) 
final case class ReaderT[S, M[_], A](runReaderT : S => M[A])
```

```haskell
newtype MaybeT    m a = MaybeT  { runMaybeT  :: m (Maybe a) }
newtype StateT  s m a = StateT  { runStateT  :: s -> m (a, s) }
newtype ReaderT s m a = ReaderT { runReaderT :: s -> m a }
```

---

```scala
// With the compiler plugin -Ykind-projector:underscores enabled
// one can define a type lambda with the same syntax used for 
// a term lambda
def program: MaybeT[ReaderT[String, IO, _], Int] = ...
```

```haskell
program :: MaybeT (ReaderT String IO) Int
program = ...
```

Using a monad stack allows expressing a program that can perform 3 kinds of side effects:
failure (`MaybeT`), reading a global immutable configuration (`ReaderT`) and performing I/O (`IO`)  

However, programming against a particular monad stack forces one to use a specific implementation
_breaking encapsulation_ <sup>[\^2](#resources)</sup>

## MTL / Tagless Final <sup>[\^3](#resources)</sup>

```scala
trait CoinFlip[F[_]] { def flipCoin: F[Boolean] }
trait Console[F[_]]  { def printLine(s: String): F[Unit] }

def maybeDouble[M[_]: Monad: CoinFlip: Console](n: Int): M[Int] = for 
  _     <- Console[M].printLine("Flipping a coin")
  heads <- CoinFlip[M].flipCoin
  yield (if heads then n*2 else n)
```

```haskell
class CoinFlip m where flipCoin :: m Bool
class Console  m where printLine :: String -> m ()

maybeDouble :: (Monad m, CoinFlip m, Console m) => Int -> m Int
maybeDouble n = do
  printLine "Flipping a coin"
  heads <- flipCoin
  pure $ if heads then n*2 else n
```

---

## Free monads

```scala
def maybeDouble(n: Int): App[Int] = for
  _     <- print("Flipping a coin")
  heads <- flipCoin
  yield (if heads then n*2 else n)
```

```haskell
maybeDouble :: Int -> App Int
maybeDouble n = do
  println "Flipping a coin"
  heads <- flipCoin
  pure $ if heads then n*2 else n
```

---

## Ad hoc languages

```haskell
structural ability CoinFlip where flipCoin : Boolean
structural ability Console  where printLine : Text -> ()

maybeDouble : Nat ->  {CoinFlip, Console} Nat
maybeDouble n =
  printLine "Flipping a coin!"
  heads = flipCoin
  if heads then n*2 else n
  -- One can use a direct style, no monadic binding:
  -- if flipCoin then n*2 else n
```
